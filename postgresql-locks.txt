n PostgreSQL, you can use row-level locking to ensure that multiple processes can work with the same data without conflicts. This is particularly useful in real-time processing of the same payload.

Row-level locks do not affect data querying; they block only writers and lockers to the same row1. These locks are released at transaction end or during savepoint rollback, just like table-level locks1.

To lock a specific row, you can use the SELECT...FOR UPDATE construct. This will exclusively lock the selected record(s) until the transaction finishes2. Hereâ€™s an example:

SQL
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.

BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE your_condition FOR UPDATE;
-- Your update operations here
COMMIT;
In this example, replace your_table with the name of your table and your_condition with the condition that identifies the row(s) you want to lock. The locked row(s) can then be updated within the same transaction.

Remember, the lock is held until the end of the transaction. So, other transactions attempting to update the same row will be blocked until the first transaction is committed or rolled back3.

Please note that plain SELECT queries are not blocked by these locks3. If you need to check which rows in a table are locked by concurrent transactions, you could use a query like this4:

SQL
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.

SELECT id FROM your_table WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM your_table FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED);
This will return the IDs of all rows that are not currently locked4.

Please replace id and your_table with your actual column name and table name respectively.

Remember to always handle locks with care to prevent deadlocks and maintain the performance of your database1. If youâ€™re new to PostgreSQL or not sure about something, itâ€™s a good idea to test on a non-production database first. Let me know if you need more help! ðŸ˜Š

In Python, you can use the psycopg2 module to interact with PostgreSQL and perform row-level locking. The SELECT...FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED statement can be used to lock rows and skip those that are already locked1. This is particularly useful in real-time processing of the same payload across multiple machines1.

However, when dealing with real-time processes, you might encounter situations where a process fails and needs to retry. This is where the backoff module comes in handy. The backoff module in Python provides function decorators for flexible backoff and retry loop handling. This can be useful when youâ€™re dealing with temporary issues such as network problems or rate limiting.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might use the backoff module with psycopg2 for row-level locking:

Python
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.

import psycopg2
import backoff

# Establish a connection to the database
conn = psycopg2.connect(database="your_database", user="your_username", password="your_password", host="127.0.0.1", port="5432")

# Define a backoff handler
def backoff_hdlr(details):
    print("Backing off {wait:0.1f} seconds after {tries} tries".format(**details))

@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo, psycopg2.OperationalError, max_tries=10, on_backoff=backoff_hdlr)
def process_row():
    # Start a new transaction
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        # Lock a row and skip if it's already locked
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE your_condition FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED")
        row = cur.fetchone()

        if row is not None:
            # Process the row here
            pass

        # Commit the transaction
        conn.commit()

# Process rows with automatic retry on failure
while True:
    process_row()
In this example, replace your_database, your_username, your_password, your_table, and your_condition with your actual database name, username, password, table name, and condition respectively.

This script will continuously process rows from the database, automatically retrying with exponential backoff if an psycopg2.OperationalError (such as a network error) occurs.

Please note that you should handle locks with care to prevent deadlocks and maintain the performance of your database1. If youâ€™re new to PostgreSQL or not sure about something, itâ€™s a good idea to test on a non-production database first. Let me know if you need more help! ðŸ˜Š

Can you show me an example of row-level locking with multiple conditions?
--------------------------------------
Sure, you can use multiple conditions in the WHERE clause of your SELECT...FOR UPDATE statement to lock rows that meet all the conditions. Hereâ€™s an example:

SQL
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.

BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 FOR UPDATE;
-- Your update operations here
COMMIT;
In this example, replace your_table with the name of your table and condition1, condition2, and condition3 with the conditions that identify the rows you want to lock. The locked rows can then be updated within the same transaction.

Remember, the lock is held until the end of the transaction. So, other transactions attempting to update the same row will be blocked until the first transaction is committed or rolled back.

Please note that plain SELECT queries are not blocked by these locks. If you need to check which rows in a table are locked by concurrent transactions, you could use a query like this:

SQL
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.

SELECT id FROM your_table WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM your_table WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED);
This will return the IDs of all rows that are not currently locked.

Please replace id, your_table, and condition1, condition2, and condition3 with your actual column name, table name, and conditions respectively.
